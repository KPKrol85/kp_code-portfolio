> A professional, long-term portfolio showcasing real-world web projects and SaaS-style web applications.

**KP_Code** is a long-term, structured **professional portfolio project** focused on building **50 high-quality web projects** across multiple industries and modern technology stacks.

This repository is a **monorepo** documenting real, production-ready work — including both professional websites and **SaaS-style web applications** — built with clean architecture, scalability in mind, and strong attention to UI/UX and code quality.

The goal of this portfolio is not quantity, but **depth, consistency, and professional growth**.

## 🚀 Portfolio Roadmap (50 Projects)

The portfolio is divided into **four technical stages**, each representing a clear step in professional development:

1. **HTML / CSS / JavaScript (20 projects)**  
   Solid fundamentals, semantic HTML, accessibility, performance, clean CSS architecture, and vanilla JS logic.

2. **Tailwind CSS (10 projects)**  
   Utility-first workflows, design systems, rapid prototyping, and scalable UI patterns.

3. **React (10 projects)**  
   Component-based architecture, state management, reusable UI logic, modern frontend practices.

4. **Full-stack (10 projects)**  
   Complete applications including backend logic, APIs, databases, authentication, and deployment.

Each project belongs to a **specific industry**, ensuring realistic business contexts rather than artificial demos.
